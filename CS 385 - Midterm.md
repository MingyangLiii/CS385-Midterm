In the scenario in which people use traditional mouse-based or touchpad-based pointing interaction to select multiple items, people replies on a physical mouse or touchpad to control a cursor on the screen, translating the hand movements into precise cursor movement on the screen.

The mechanism behind this pointing interaction technique is that mouse or touchpad detects the movement by optical or mechanical sensors and translates this into cursor movement. Buttons enables clicking, dragging by detecting mouse-up, mouse-move, and mouse-down. It works for many tasks, however, when it meets some cases which need multiple clicks at different locations with no mattering the clicking sequence, it becomes inefficient. 

In the scenario above, user need to click multiple items one-by-one to select all of them. This takes 6 moves and 6 clicks operations. This is really annoying if the items need to be selected become a large number.

### 2. Brush Mode

When the command is clicked and hold for 0.75 second, the mode will change to brush mode, where user can select multiple items by one click and drag operation. User can do the same operation to change back to Click Mode.

The brush will detect user's mouse-down, mouse-move, and mouse-up, to create a rectangular area. Every items get in touch with this area will be selected.

There will be a brush box marked by dashed line border to give realtime feedback to user.
